# TerranSoul — Milestones

> **To continue development, tell the AI agent:**
>
> ```
> Continue
> ```
>
> The agent will read this file, find the next chunk with status `not-started`,
> implement it, update the status to `done`, update `Next Chunk`, and log details
> in `rules/completion-log.md`.

> **ENFORCEMENT RULE — Completed chunks must be archived.**
>
> When a chunk is marked `done`:
> 1. Log full details (date, goal, architecture, files created/modified, test counts) in `rules/completion-log.md`.
> 2. **Remove the done row from this file.** `milestones.md` contains only `not-started` chunks.
> 3. If an entire phase has no remaining rows, replace the table with: `✅ Phase N complete — see completion-log.md`.
> 4. Update the `Next Chunk` section to point to the next `not-started` chunk.
>
> This rule is mandatory for every AI agent session. Never leave done rows in milestones.md.

## Completed Phases

✅ Chunk 001 — Project Scaffold — see `rules/completion-log.md`

37 files created. Tauri 2.0 + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Three.js + @pixiv/three-vrm + Pinia.
Rust backend: chat/agent/character commands, stub agent, orchestrator.
`npm run build` and `cargo check` both pass.

✅ CI Restructure — see `rules/completion-log.md`

Consolidated 5 separate CI jobs (frontend-build, rust-build, tauri-build, vitest, playwright-e2e)
into 3 jobs (build-and-test, vitest, playwright-e2e). Removed `pull_request` trigger to eliminate
double-firing on copilot branches. Added `paths` filter so CI only runs when source files change.
Modeled after [devstress/My3DLearning eip-ci.yml](https://github.com/devstress/My3DLearning/blob/main/.github/workflows/eip-ci.yml).

✅ Chunk 002 — Chat UI Polish & Vitest Component Tests — see `rules/completion-log.md`

### Phase 9 — Medium Priority (Chunks 094–098)

| Chunk | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 094 | **Model Position Saving** — Persist camera orbit position, zoom, rotation per model. Resume user's preferred viewing angle on app restart. Store in Tauri settings alongside model selection. | `not-started` |
| 095 | **Procedural Gesture Blending (MANN-inspired)** — Learn from AI4Animation MANN approach: instead of hardcoded JSON keyframes, use lightweight ML or procedural blending to generate smooth transitions between emotion states. Train on existing gesture data. Replace stiff cross-fades with natural motion. | `not-started` |
| 096 | **Speaker Diarization** — Detect multiple speakers in room (VibeVoice-ASR-7B pattern). Tag "who said what" in conversation log. Useful for group scenarios or streaming. | `not-started` |
| 097 | **Hotword-Boosted ASR** — Let users define domain-specific keywords (character names, game terms) that ASR should recognize better. VibeVoice supports hotword injection. | `not-started` |
| 098 | **Presence / Greeting System** — Auto-greeting when user appears (timer-based or face detection), auto-goodbye when away. Track "away duration" for different responses (aituber-kit pattern). | `not-started` |

### Phase 9 — Lower Priority (Chunks 115–119)

| Chunk | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 115 | **Live2D Support** — Add Live2D rendering alongside VRM using renderer abstraction layer (aituber-kit pattern). Useful for users who prefer 2D or have only 2D models. | `not-started` |
| 116 | **Screen Recording / Vision** — Extend beyond static context: real-time screen activity analysis (Open-LLM-VTuber pattern). Use Tauri window capture API. Character can comment on what user is doing. | `not-started` |
| 117 | **Docker Containerization** — Run TerranSoul in isolated containers for CI/testing and server deployment (Open-LLM-VTuber pattern). CPU/GPU variants. | `not-started` |
| 118 | **Chat Log Export** — JSON export with timestamps, sentiment tags, emotion metadata. Build on existing conversation persistence. | `not-started` |
| 119 | **Language Translation Layer** — Accept input in one language, TTS output in another. Use LLM for translation. Store original + translated text. | `not-started` |

## Phase 9.1 — UI/UX (Open-LLM-VTuber Patterns)

✅ Chunk 085 — UI/UX Overhaul — see `rules/completion-log.md`

Full-screen character layout, floating subtitle overlay, collapsible input footer,
animated AI state pill, slide-over chat drawer. Learned from Open-LLM-VTuber-Web.

---

## Phase 6.5 — UI Polish, UX Refinement & Art

> **Goal:** Elevate TerranSoul's visual identity and user experience with a unified design
> system, richer background art, markdown-rendered chat, and polished navigation micro-interactions.

| Chunk | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| (Chunks 065–068 complete — Design system, backgrounds, chat UX, navigation polish.) | | |

---

## Phase 5.5 — Three-Tier Brain (Free API / Paid API / Local LLM)

> **Goal:** Make TerranSoul work out of the box with zero setup by defaulting
> to free cloud LLM APIs. Users can optionally upgrade to paid APIs or local
> Ollama. Free providers are sourced from awesome-free-llm-apis and auto-rotated
> when rate-limited. See `rules/research-reverse-engineering.md` §8.

✅ Phase 5.5 complete — see completion-log.md

---

## Phase 4 — Brain & Memory (Local LLM + Persistent Memory)

✅ Chunk 040 — Brain (Local LLM via Ollama) — see `rules/completion-log.md`

Hardware analysis, tiered model recommendations (Gemma 3, Phi-4 Mini, TinyLlama).
OllamaAgent with full conversation history. 7 Tauri commands. BrainSetupView.vue wizard.
38 Rust tests, 11 Vitest tests.

✅ Chunk 041 — Long/Short-term Memory + Brain-powered recall — see `rules/completion-log.md`

SQLite-backed MemoryStore (rusqlite). Brain reuses active Ollama model for:
- Automatic memory extraction from sessions
- Session summarization into memory entries
- Semantic memory search (LLM-ranked, keyword fallback)
Short-term memory = last 20 messages injected into each Ollama call.
9 Tauri commands. MemoryView.vue + MemoryGraph.vue (cytoscape.js).
14 Rust tests + 10 Vitest tests.

## Phase 2 — TerranSoul Link (Cross-Device)

> **Goal:** TerranSoul on all devices behaves like "one assistant."
> Pair devices, sync conversations, route commands remotely.

✅ Phase 2 complete — see completion-log.md

---

## Phase 3 — AI Package Manager & Agent Marketplace

> **Goal:** Install, update, and remove AI agents as packages across devices.
> Community agent registry with one-command install.

✅ Chunk 030 — Package Manifest Format — see `rules/completion-log.md`

## Phase 5 — Desktop Experience (Overlay & Streaming)

> **Goal:** Transform the desktop window into a proper overlay companion.
> Dual-mode window (normal + pet mode), selective click-through, multi-monitor,
> streaming LLM responses, emotion-driven character reactions.
> Patterns learned from Open-LLM-VTuber and aituber-kit — see `rules/research-reverse-engineering.md`.

✅ Phase 5 complete — see completion-log.md

---

## Phase 6 — Voice (User-Defined ASR/TTS)

> **Goal:** Add voice input/output. Users choose their own voice provider — same
> philosophy as the brain system where users pick their own LLM model.
> TerranSoul provides the abstraction layer; users bring their preferred engine.
> Reference implementations studied: VibeVoice, sherpa-onnx, Edge TTS, OpenAI Whisper — see `rules/research-reverse-engineering.md`.

| Chunk | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| (Phase 6 complete — chunks 060–064 done. Open-LLM-VTuber removed; Edge TTS + Whisper API in pure Rust; desktop pet overlay.) | | |

---

## Phase 7 — VRM Model Security (Anti-Exploit & Asset Protection)

📦 Moved back to `rules/backlog.md` — chunks 100–105 (renumbered). Do not start until user says so.

---

## Phase 8 — Brain-Driven Animation (AI4Animation for VRM)

> **Goal:** Use the LLM brain as an animation controller. Instead of pre-baked
> keyframe clips, the brain generates pose parameters (blend weights, bone
> offsets, gesture tags) that drive VRM character animation in realtime.
> Inspired by AI4Animation-js (SIGGRAPH 2018 MANN), adapted for stationary
> VRM desktop companion use. See `rules/research-reverse-engineering.md` §7.

✅ Phase 8 complete (chunks 080–084) — see completion-log.md
