# Commercial-Licence Audit — 2026-04-24

> Triggered by: agent task requirement *"check to make sure all package
> or integrations or libraries meet the commercial usage."*

This document records the commercial-use review of every third-party
package, integration, and library shipped in the TerranSoul desktop app.
The bar is **strict commercial use**: a TerranSoul build distributed as
a paid commercial product (or as part of one) must not require any
extra licence purchase, must not violate any upstream Terms of Service,
and must not silently send user data to any third-party endpoint.

The audit is repeated whenever a new dependency is added (see
`rules/coding-standards.md` *"Use Existing Libraries First"* — the
checklist already includes a licence step). When in doubt, prefer
permissive (MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD / ISC / MPL-2.0) and prefer
zero-network libraries over SaaS integrations.

### GitHub advisory database

`gh-advisory-database` scan (2026-04-24): **no vulnerabilities** in the
spot-checked subset. Re-run the scan whenever a dependency version
changes.

## � Conditional clearance (use-based / RAIL-family licenses)

Some downloadable assets — primarily on-device ML model weights — ship
under **use-based** licenses that permit commercial use *with*
behavioural restrictions on downstream applications. These are not
classic FOSS licenses and require us to (a) comply with the restriction
list, (b) propagate the same restrictions to end users, and (c) attribute
the upstream model card. They are cleared for TerranSoul only on the
conditions recorded here.

### Supertonic TTS — model weights (`Supertone/supertonic-3`)

- **Upstream:** <https://github.com/supertone-inc/supertonic> +
  <https://huggingface.co/Supertone/supertonic-3>
- **Sample code license:** MIT (the upstream `rust/`, `py/`, `cpp/` etc.
  example directories). Cleared without restriction.
- **Model weights license:** **OpenRAIL-M v1** (Open Responsible AI
  License — Model). Use-based; commercial use permitted with the
  upstream model card's restriction list.
- **Cleared on conditions** (see
  [docs/supertonic-integration-research.md](supertonic-integration-research.md)
  for full analysis):
  1. End-user consent dialog in TerranSoul's first-run TTS install UX
     names the OpenRAIL-M restrictions in plain English and links to the
     upstream model card. Implemented in chunk **TTS-SUPERTONIC-1c**.
  2. Restrictions propagate to derivative use: a short notice appears in
     the running app's About / Credits surface.
  3. Attribution to Supertone Inc. + the three arXiv papers
     (arXiv:2503.23108, arXiv:2509.11084, arXiv:2509.19091) lives in
     [`CREDITS.md`](../CREDITS.md).
  4. Model weights are **not** bundled in the Tauri installer — they are
     downloaded on first use after explicit user consent. The ~300 MB
     download size is disclosed before any bytes flow.
- **Headline use restrictions** (canonical OpenRAIL-M v1 surface; the
  upstream model card is authoritative): no discrimination/harassment,
  no mass surveillance, no malicious mis-/disinformation, no
  CSAM/non-consensual intimate imagery, no automated legal/medical/
  financial advice without human review, and the same restrictions must
  travel with any redistribution.
- **Training framework note:** Supertonic was trained with PyTorch
  (BSD-3-Clause). PyTorch is **not** redistributed by Supertonic and is
  **not** a runtime dependency for TerranSoul (we load ONNX assets via
  the `ort` crate). PyTorch's license therefore does not apply to
  TerranSoul.

> **Policy:** any future on-device model that ships under a RAIL-family

## �🚫 Removed (commercial blockers)

The following integrations were present in earlier builds but removed
on 2026-04-24 because they fail the strict commercial-use bar:

### `msedge-tts` (Rust crate, was used in `src-tauri/src/voice/edge_tts.rs`)

- **Crate licence:** MIT (commercial-OK as code).
- **Blocker:** the crate calls Microsoft Edge's undocumented
  `speech.platform.bing.com` *"Read Aloud"* WebSocket endpoint. That
  endpoint is **not** part of any public Microsoft API; the Microsoft
  Services Agreement directs commercial users to **paid Azure
  Cognitive Services — Text to Speech** instead. Programmatic
  third-party use of the Edge endpoint is not sanctioned by Microsoft
  and has historically been rate-limited or blocked when abuse is
  detected.
- **Replacement:** new `web-speech` TTS provider (browser
  `SpeechSynthesis` API). The backend's `synthesize_tts` command
  returns `Vec::new()` for `web-speech`, and the existing
  `useTtsPlayback` composable already falls back to
  `speechSynthesis.speak()` whenever the WAV payload is empty. Browser
  TTS is built into every Tauri-supported platform, has no API key, no
  network round-trip, no telemetry, and no third-party ToS to worry
  about. If higher-quality cloud voices are desired, the
  user-supplied **OpenAI TTS** provider remains available with an
  explicit API key.

### `@vercel/analytics` + `@vercel/speed-insights` (npm, was mounted in `src/App.vue`)

- **Library licence:** MPL-2.0 (commercial-OK as code).
- **Blocker 1:** runtime telemetry is sent to Vercel's analytics
  servers without a user-visible privacy contract. This conflicts with
  TerranSoul's local-first privacy posture (camera frames never leave
  the device, persona suggestions are computed locally, brain memories
  live in SQLite, etc.).
- **Blocker 2:** Vercel's free Web Analytics tier is restricted to
  *non-commercial / personal* projects. Commercial use requires a paid
  Vercel plan and is a poor fit for a desktop binary that doesn't run
  on Vercel.
- **Replacement:** none. A privacy-first desktop app should not phone
  home for usage analytics. If a future opt-in telemetry channel is
  desired, it must be built as a first-party service with explicit
  user consent and a privacy policy.
- **Bonus removal:** `vue-router` was only included to satisfy the
  Vercel libraries' unconditional `useRoute()` calls. With Vercel
  removed, the router was deleted too.

## Process

1. New dependencies are evaluated against the table above before the
   PR that adds them is opened — see the
   *"Use Existing Libraries First"* checklist in
   `rules/coding-standards.md` (steps 3 & 4).
2. The `gh-advisory-database` MCP tool must be invoked for every new
   dependency on a supported ecosystem (npm, rust, pip, …).
3. Any integration that calls a SaaS endpoint must be reviewed for
   ToS compliance, **even if** the client library itself is
   permissively licensed.
4. Telemetry / analytics integrations are forbidden in the desktop
   binary. A future opt-in telemetry surface, if any, must be a
   first-party service with explicit user consent.
