## Honest summary

**TerranSoul cannot compete with GitNexus on code intelligence today.**

GitNexus is a *code-knowledge-graph* engine: tree-sitter → typed
relationships (CALLS, IMPORTS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS) → cluster
detection → execution-flow tracing → 16 MCP tools tuned for AI
coding agents.

**CocoIndex is a different beast — an incremental data pipeline
framework**, not a code-intelligence tool per se. Its flagship
"CocoIndex-code" MCP server uses the framework to deliver AST-aware
incremental code indexing with semantic search, call graphs, and
blast-radius analysis. The key insight: **Δ-only processing** — when
one file changes, only that file is re-parsed and only affected
embeddings/edges are recomputed. Hash-based memoization and per-row
lineage make re-indexing near-instant (80–90% cache hits).

TerranSoul's brain is a *companion-memory* engine: SQLite memory
store → hybrid search (BM25 + vector + recency + RRF) → 8 MCP tools
tuned for retrieving facts the companion has been told.

These are **different products**. The two overlap only at the MCP
boundary (both serve tools to Copilot/Codex/Claude Code). Catching
up on the code-intelligence side is a real engineering effort —
not a refactor.

The shipped 31.x work closed the first native gap: symbol indexing,
call-graph resolution, clustering, process tracing, native MCP tools,
and graph-backed rename. The new Phase 37 work is the honest path to
full clean-room parity for *TerranSoul as a coding companion*: broader
language coverage, richer resolution, incremental updates, resources,
guided workflows, multi-repo awareness, and a dense code-graph workbench.

## 2026-05-05 clean-room target

GitNexus's strongest public lesson is **precomputed relational
intelligence**: do expensive graph construction before the model asks a
question, then return complete context in one tool call. TerranSoul should
implement that natively on top of `coding/symbol_index.rs`,
`coding/processes.rs`, SQLite, and MCP resources/prompts.

The Web UI lesson is equally important. The useful product pattern is not a
particular color palette or component implementation; it is the interaction
loop: global graph canvas, file tree, grounded code-reference panel, chat
citations that focus graph/code, visible tool-call cards, process diagrams,
repo switcher, index status, and blast-radius highlights. TerranSoul should
adapt that as a Vue/Pinia workbench inside the Brain/Coding surface using
existing `--ts-*` tokens and neutral naming.

## Capability matrix

| Capability | GitNexus | CocoIndex / CocoIndex-code | TerranSoul today | Gap | Tracked |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Index pipeline** | tree-sitter native bindings, 14 languages, multi-phase pipeline (structure / parse / resolve / cluster / process / search) | AST-aware chunking (Python, TS, Rust, Go), incremental Delta-only processing, hash-based memoization (`@coco.fn(memo=True)`) | tree-sitter parsing for Rust + TypeScript/TSX by default, Python/Go/Java/C/C++ behind parser feature flags, symbol + edge extraction, `code_symbols` + `code_edges` SQLite tables, `code_index_repo` Tauri command | Partial (7/14 languages when feature-gated parsers are built; no semantic symbol embeddings yet) | Chunks 31.3 + 37.3 (**shipped**) |
| **Incremental re-indexing** | Not documented (full re-index implied on `detect_changes`) | Core differentiator: Delta-only — only changed files re-parse/re-embed. 80-90% cache hits on re-index. Hash of input + hash of code determines staleness. Per-row provenance traces target back to source byte | `index_repo` stores `code_file_hashes`, skips unchanged files, removes deleted files, and re-parses changed files only | Partial — file-level content-hash incremental indexing shipped; finer symbol-level provenance remains future | Chunk 37.4 (**shipped**) |
| **Storage** | LadybugDB embedded graph DB (formerly KuzuDB), Cypher queries, vector index | Pluggable targets: pgvector, LanceDB, Neo4j, Qdrant, Pinecone, Turbopuffer.

| **Type resolution / receiver inference** | Constructor inference, `self`/`this` mapping, return-aware loop inference | Not documented separately | None | Total | Future (post-31.4) |
| **Functional clustering** | Leiden community detection on the symbol graph | Global repo view for duplicates and architecture (via MCP server) | Label-propagation clustering + `code_clusters` table | Partial — lighter algorithm than Leiden, sufficient for companion | **Shipped (31.5)** |
| **Execution-flow / process tracing** | Entry-point scoring → call-chain traces → `process_id` indexing | Not documented as a distinct feature | BFS call-chain traces from scored entry points → `code_processes` table | Partial — scoring heuristics are simpler, no ML inference | **Shipped (31.5)** |

| **Data lineage / provenance** | Not documented | End-to-end lineage — every target row traces back to exact source byte. Debuggable, auditable, regulator-friendly | None | Total — CocoIndex's unique strength | Future (informational — not critical for companion use-case) |
| **`query` MCP tool (process-grouped search)** | Returns processes + step-indexed symbols + definitions | Semantic code search tool in CocoIndex-code MCP server | `code_query` native MCP tool: symbol-name/file search against symbol index, process-grouped when clusters exist | Shipped — native implementation | **Shipped (31.6)** |
| **`context` MCP tool (360° symbol view)** | incoming/outgoing CALLS, IMPORTS, processes, depth grouping | Part of code intelligence MCP surface | `code_context` native MCP tool: call graph + cluster membership + process participation | Shipped — native implementation | **Shipped (31.6)** |
| **`impact` MCP tool (blast-radius)** | Upstream/downstream traversal with confidence + relation filters | Blast-radius analysis in CocoIndex-code | `code_impact` native MCP tool: BFS over incoming call edges with depth grouping | Shipped — native implementation | **Shipped (31.6)** |

| **Embeddings** | HF transformers.js (GPU/CPU/WebGPU) | sentence-transformers / OpenAI / any embedding provider | Ollama `nomic-embed-text` (768-dim) + cloud `/v1/embeddings` | Different vendor, similar coverage | None — TerranSoul's choice is fine |
| **Privacy / locality** | All local, `.gitnexus/` in repo, no network | Configurable — can be fully local (local embedding + LanceDB) or cloud targets | All local, `mcp-data/` in repo, no network | Match | — |
| **MCP transports** | stdio (Cursor/Claude Code/Codex/Windsurf/OpenCode) + HTTP for Web UI | MCP server via CocoIndex-code (Claude Code, Cursor, others) | stdio + HTTP, both | Match (after Chunk 30.7.5) | — |
| **Zero-config setup** | `gitnexus setup` auto-detects editors and writes global MCP configs | `pip install cocoindex` + one Python file | `.vscode/mcp.json` plus `scripts/copilot-start-mcp.mjs`; no editor-wide setup writer yet | Partial | Phase 37.10 |

## What we keep (TerranSoul-original strengths)

- Companion brain — persona, voice, charisma, skill tree, persistent
  memory across all workspaces — entirely outside GitNexus's scope.
- Multi-provider LLM brain (Ollama / paid cloud / free cloud) with
  silent local-first default.
- Tauri-native desktop integration, VRM avatar, motion / animation
  pipeline.
- Knowledge-graph design (`docs/brain-advanced-design.md`) is a
  *memory* graph, not a *code* graph — they don't conflict; they
  could share a tree-sitter ingest layer in the future.

## What we deliberately do NOT chase

- **Cypher / LadybugDB** — adopting an embedded graph DB is a large
  dependency; a pragmatic v1 can use SQLite tables for nodes/edges
  and only consider a graph DB if perf demands it.
- **Full CocoIndex-style Δ pipeline** — CocoIndex is a general-purpose
  incremental ETL framework (Python + Rust, Postgres state store,
  pluggable targets). TerranSoul is a single-binary Tauri app with
  SQLite. Adopting their full lineage/memoization model would require
  a Postgres dependency and Python runtime. Instead, we adopt the
  *principle* (content-hash per file, skip unchanged files) in our
  own Rust code post-31.5.
- **Multi-repo group sync / contracts** — TerranSoul is a
  per-machine companion; cross-machine code-graph sync is an
  enterprise feature with a different threat model.
- **Cloud SaaS / Kubernetes signed-image flow** — out of scope.
- **Installing or default-spawning GitNexus.** PolyForm-NC is not compatible
  with TerranSoul's MIT licensing goals. Do not add GitNexus to package
  dependencies, Docker flows, setup scripts, MCP startup, or sidecar paths.
  The sidecar bridge has been removed entirely.
- **Copying any GitNexus source, prompts, generated skills, assets, or UI
  implementation.** We design from public docs, public behaviour, and DeepWiki
  summaries only.
- **Copying CocoIndex source.** While Apache 2.0 is compatible,
  CocoIndex is a Python framework — we study its architecture
  patterns (incremental Δ, hash-memoization, lineage) and implement
  them idiomatically in Rust.

## Next steps (queued)

See `rules/milestones.md` for the active Phase 37 chunk rows. The rows are
ordered so each chunk produces a usable increment:

| Chunk | What it adds | Why it's first |
|---|---|---|
| 37.1 | Clean-room architecture spec + sidecar removal guardrails | Prevents accidental noncommercial dependency creep before implementation continues. |
| 37.2 | Incremental repo registry + content-hash indexing | Makes native code intelligence fast enough for default MCP use. |
| 37.3 | Multi-language parser expansion | Moves beyond Rust/TypeScript toward GitNexus-style language breadth. |
| 37.4 | Import, heritage, receiver, and type-resolution upgrades | Improves graph confidence and cross-file correctness. |
| 37.5 | Confidence-scored relation schema + provenance | Gives tools auditable blast-radius and rename confidence. |
| 37.6 | Clusters, process traces, and process-grouped search | Strengthens the precomputed intelligence layer. |
| 37.7 | Hybrid semantic code search | Adds BM25 + embeddings + RRF over code entities. |
| 37.8 | Diff impact / pre-commit risk overlay | Replaces sidecar `detect_changes` natively. |
| 37.9 | Graph-backed rename polish | Expands dry-run edit plans with confidence buckets and review UI. |
| 37.10 | MCP resources/prompts + setup writer | Gives agents instant repo context and guided workflows. |
| 37.11 | Native code-graph workbench UI | Adapts the graph/chat/code-reference UX pattern in Vue. |
| 37.12 | Generated repo skills + code wiki | Produces durable, reviewable architectural context from the native graph. |
| 37.13 | Multi-repo groups and contracts | Adds cross-repo/service awareness after single-repo parity is solid. |
